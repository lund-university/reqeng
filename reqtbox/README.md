# `reqtbox` - a software requirements cheat sheet

* The `reqtbox` (pronounced *reckteebox*, eller *kravboxen* p√• svenska) is a summary of **important areas in software requirements engineering**.

* Each box in `reqtbox` has boxes inside with more details, in a hierarchical structure.

* Your personal requirements engineering *knowledge and skills* is a **toolbox** for addressing each box in `reqtbox`.

* You can use `reqtbox` when **brainstorming** about a system and its requirements.

* You can use `reqtbox` to think both **inside and outside** of each box - requirements engineering is all about **software innovation** to provide *value for users in a novel way*.

* The boxes in `reqtbox` are not clean partitions of the requirements engineering universe; real requirements are often overlapping and incomplete! (But it is often worth it to try to get a little closer to the ideals of atomicity and completeness...)
